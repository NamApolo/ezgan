# ezgan
An extremely simple generative adversarial network, built with TensorFlow. I've written it as a personal exercise to help myself grasp the basics of GANs, and hope that it might be a useful illustration.

**This is a work in progress**, and is full of all manner of hacks and hard-coded shortcuts that will disappear or (hopefully) become more elegant as I make revisions.

This GAN generates images like these:

<table style="border:0">
    <tr style="border:0">
        <td style="border:0">
            <img src="images/0.png"/>
        </td>
        <td style="border:0">
            <img src="images/1.png"/>
        </td>
        <td style="border:0">
            <img src="images/3.png"/>
        </td>
        <td style="border:0">
            <img src="images/3a.png"/>
        </td>
        <td style="border:0">
            <img src="images/5.png"/>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
