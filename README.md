# ezgan
An extremely simple generative adversarial network, built with TensorFlow. I've written it as a personal exercise to help myself grasp the basics of GANs, and hope that it might be a useful illustration.

**This is a work in progress**, and is full of all manner of hacks and hard-coded shortcuts that will disappear or (hopefully) become more elegant as I make revisions.
